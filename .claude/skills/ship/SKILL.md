description: Cut a release of this plugin marketplace - verifies the plugin version, CHANGELOG entry, README, and git state all agree, then commits any pending work, pushes, tags the version, and creates a GitHub release whose notes come from the changelog entry. Use when the user says "/ship", "ship it", "cut a release", "publish a release", "tag and release", or asks to get the latest plugin changes onto GitHub.

# Ship a release

Release the `supacode` plugin: prove the repo is internally consistent, then
tag it and publish a GitHub release. The version in
`plugins/supacode/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the single source of truth —
the git tag and release name follow it, never the other way around.

Nothing here merges or force-pushes, and every check that fails stops the
ship with an explanation rather than "fixing" things silently.

## 1. Preflight — all must pass

Report exactly what failed and stop if any check fails.

1. **Repo root:** you are in the marketplace repo (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
   exists). Read `<version>` from `plugins/supacode/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
2. **Changelog current:** `CHANGELOG.md` has a `## <version>` section at the
   top. Missing ⇒ stop and tell the user what's unreleased — offer to draft
   the entry from the commits since the last tag, but let them approve the
   wording; changelog prose is theirs.
3. **Version is new:** no existing git tag `v<version>` (`git tag -l`), and
   no published release with that tag if a remote exists. Already shipped ⇒
   stop; the fix is a version bump, not a retag.
4. **Skills validate:** `claude plugin validate .` passes.
5. **Changelog covers the work:** compare `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline`
   (or all commits, if no tag yet) against the top changelog section. Any
   skill change with no corresponding changelog line ⇒ stop and list the gaps.
   Docs-only commits (README, CLAUDE.md, this skill) need no entry.
6. **Docs not stale:** if commits since the last tag touched
   `plugins/supacode/skills/`, confirm `README.md`'s skills table and
   `WORKFLOWS.md` reflect them. Drift ⇒ stop and say precisely what looks out
   of date. (Same check CLAUDE.md requires after any skill edit.)

## 2. Commit pending work

If `git status --porcelain` is non-empty, show the user what's uncommitted and
commit it with a message describing the change (not "prepare release" — say
what actually changed). Never commit `CLAUDE.local.md` or anything else
gitignored; if something unexpected is staged, stop and ask.

## 3. Ensure a remote

`git remote -v`. If there is no `origin`:

- Ask the user first — creating a **public** repo publishes everything,
  including full history. Confirm the intended name and visibility.
- On approval: `gh repo create <name> --source=. --remote=origin --push`
  with `--public` or `--private` as they chose.
- Then verify the pushed content is what they expect (`gh repo view --web`
  is a fine pointer) before continuing.

If `origin` exists: `git push` (and `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>`
the first time). Never force-push.

## 4. Tag and release

```bash
git tag -a v<version> -m "v<version>"
git push origin v<version>
gh release create v<version> --title "v<version>" --notes-file <notes-file> --verify-tag
```

Build `<notes-file>` in the scratchpad from the changelog's `## <version>`
section — its bullets verbatim, since they already describe the release. Above
them add one plain-language sentence naming what a user gets from this
version, and below them a short install/upgrade line:

    Existing installs: `claude plugin update supacode@supacode-skills`
    (new installs: see the README).

`--verify-tag` is deliberate: it aborts if the tag never reached the remote,
so a release can't point at a tag nobody can fetch.

## 5. Report

Release URL, tag, version, the changelog bullets shipped, and anything the
preflight let through with a warning. Remind the user that installed plugins
still need `claude plugin update supacode@supacode-skills` — a GitHub release
doesn't reach their machine by itself.
